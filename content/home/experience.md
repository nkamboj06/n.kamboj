In her role, Navpreet	performs in-person and virtual assessments on patients and works collaboratively with an inter-professional team, both internal and external to THP to identify and facilitate access to the right services from the right provider at the right time.
The bundled care navigator role has led to 15% reduction in post-operative hospital days, 25% reduction in readmission to hospital within 30 days of discharge, and 33% reduction in ED visits within 30 days after discharge. 

Navpreet is also a registered nurse with experience working in the hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and cardiology departments."""
